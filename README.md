### Select a photo/video from the device library or directly from the camera

This example is based on [react-native-image-picker](https://github.com/marcshilling/react-native-image-picker) module.

After installing a module and linking (react-native link), manual installation was unnecessary (**react native 0.40**).

Only add ```permission``` to Info.plist (as official docs says (point 4 in Manual Installation on IOS)).


### How to run this example:

- ```clone the repo```
- ```npm install```
- ```react-native link```
- ```restart the server```
- ```react-native run-ios```
